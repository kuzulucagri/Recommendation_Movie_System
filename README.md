# Recommendation_Movie_System

In that project, I studied on http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-100k.zip dataset.

I built architectural design, data cluster and preprocessing.

While I was building on that project I used numpy,pandas,matplotlib,scikit learn etc. libraries.

Also, I used collobaration filtering, cosines similarity, model filtering, SVD(Singular Value Decomposition) and RMSE(Root Mean Square Error) methods.
